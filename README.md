[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/elwayman02/ember-bug-widget.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/elwayman02/ember-bug-widget)

This addon is a lightweight drop-in bug-reporting widget for your Ember application.  Simply add the bug-widget to your application.hbs template and tell it where your bugs should be reported:

```
{{bug-widget url='https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-bug-widget/issues/new'}}
```

The text of the button defaults to "Report A Bug", but can easily be configured:

```
{{bug-widget
    url='https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-bug-widget/issues/new'
    text='File An Issue'}}
```

The widget displays in the bottom right edge of the page by default, and it can currently be moved to the other three corners of the page as well:

Bottom Left -
```
{{bug-widget
    url='https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-bug-widget/issues/new'
    horizontal='left'}}
```

Top Left -
```
{{bug-widget
    url='https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-bug-widget/issues/new'
    horizontal='left'
    vertical='top'}}
```

Top Right -
```
{{bug-widget
    url='https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-bug-widget/issues/new'
    vertical='top'}}
```

Currently the widget's icons default to FontAwesome classes, but they can be configured as well:

```
{{bug-widget
    url='https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-bug-widget/issues/new'
    bugIcon='bugIconClass'
    arrowLeftIcon='leftArrowClass'
    arrowRightIcon='rightArrowClass'}}
```

Additionally, if you want the widget to be expanded by default, simply initialize the hide attribute as false:

```
{{bug-widget
    url='https://github.com/elwayman02/ember-bug-widget/issues/new'
    hide=false}}
```
